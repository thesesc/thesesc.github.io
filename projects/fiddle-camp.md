The **Chicago Scottish Fiddle Camp** is a weekend workshop for beginning to
intermediate fiddlers, led by [Tim Macdonald](http://tsmacdonald.com/) (fiddle),
[Jeremy Ward](http://timandjeremy.com/) (cello/accompaniment/beginners),
and [Meg Dedolph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meg-dedolph-7b9292b/) (dance).

The 2019 session will take place on August 24 and 25 at the Scottish Home in
North Riverside, IL.

Students will learn about the basic types of Scottish tune (strathspey, jig,
reel, slow air, march, and hornpipe), how to make dance music danceable and
listening music listenable (er, expressive), and basic improvisation. The
Scottish fiddle tradition both historically and currently has been surprisingly
educated and literate, so sheet music will be used almost exclusively, and
classical technique will be encouraged (and, if necessary, explicitly
developed!).

Students of any age (past participants have been as young as 6 and as old as
70-something) who play any fiddling-compatible acoustic instrument are invited
to attend (violin-family instruments, guitar, piano, flute, oboe, squeezebox,
etc.). Basic familiarity with reading music and "knowing where the notes are"
is very helpful, but no prior experience with any fiddling tradition is
required.

Classes will take place throughout the day either as one big group or as two
self-selected smaller groups (variously broken up by experience or by type of
instrument played), and the camp will finish with a low-pressure student
concert for the residents of Caledonia Senior Living.

Tuition is $150/student (family discount: $75 for a second child, $25 each for
a third+ child). Limited need-based financial aid is available. To qualify,
send a brief message explaining your situation and desired level of assistance.
