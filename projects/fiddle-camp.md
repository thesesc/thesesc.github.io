The **Chicago Scottish Fiddle Camp** is a weekend workshop for beginning to
intermediate fiddlers, led by [Tim Macdonald](http://tsmacdonald.com/) (fiddle),
[Jeremy Ward](http://timandjeremy.com/) (cello/accompaniment/beginners),
and [Meg Dedolph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meg-dedolph-7b9292b/) (dance).

The 2019 session will take place on August 24 and 25 at the Scottish Home in
North Riverside, IL.

# Description

Students will learn about the basic types of Scottish tune (strathspey, jig,
reel, slow air, march, and hornpipe), how to make dance music danceable and
listening music listenable (er, expressive), and basic improvisation. The
Scottish fiddle tradition both historically and currently has been surprisingly
educated and literate, so sheet music will be used almost exclusively, and
classical technique will be encouraged (and, if necessary, explicitly
developed!).

# Who's Invited?

Students of any age (past participants have been as young as 6 and as old as
70-something) who play any fiddling-compatible acoustic instrument are invited
to attend (violin-family instruments, guitar, piano, flute, oboe, squeezebox,
etc.). Basic familiarity with reading music and "knowing where the notes are"
is very helpful, but no prior experience with any fiddling tradition is
required.

# Schedule

Classes will take place throughout the day either as one big group or as two
self-selected smaller groups (variously broken up by experience or by type of
instrument played), and the camp will finish with a low-pressure student
concert for the residents of Caledonia Senior Living.

# Tuition

Thanks to the generosity of scholarship donors, the number of students already enrolled, and the low overhead of camp,
tuition is *by donation*. Comparable workshops tend to charge about $150, but we are excited to say that it is a
suggested—not required—fee. We leave it to you to determine your need for financial aid. No deposit is necessary; please
bring cash or a check (to "Tim Macdonald") to camp.

# Sheet Music
