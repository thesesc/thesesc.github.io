Here are some of the projects we're working onâ€”or will soon start working on as resources allow:
</p>

<ul class="keep-bullets">
  <li> Instructional videos about various aspects of Scottish fiddling </li>
  <li> A marketplace of books, CDs, and other media related to early Scottish culture </li>

  <li> SESC editions of significant but underappreciated works in the public domain (whose original editions we have access to), including: </li>
  <ul>

    <li> <em>The Singer Manuscript</em>, a privately-owned collection of fiddle tunes from the turn of the 19th century, thus far unknown to the wider music community</li>
    <li> <em>A Third Collection of Strathspey Reels &amp;c</em> by Niel Gow at Dunkeld (the first subject of <a href="/projects/gow_sessions">The Niel Gow Sessions</a>)</li>
    <li> <em>Part First of the Complete Repository of Original Scots Slow Strathspeys and Dances</em> by Niel Gow &amp; Sons</li>
    <li> <em>Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</em> (1817) by the unknown poet Dougal McKillop</li>
    <li> <em>Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</em> (1790) by Andrew Shirrefs</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
