**The Niel Gow Sessions** are a project to record the publications of Niel Gow and his sons, starting with their third collection of strathspey-reels. A new video by [Tim Macdonald and Jeremy Ward](http://www.timandjeremy.com) is released every Tuesday.

The project aims to raise awareness not just about the Gows' output, but about the interpretive possibilities available when reading through a historic music collection. By going through the books in order, tunes unlikely to be otherwise recorded end up being heard, and sometimes they speak to listeners in surprising but positive ways.
